These are only data samples. Complete dataset can be obtained using the code files present. The actual dataset was extended to 1100 clean images and 1110 blurry images. the model would train upon a mixture of the two. The developement set (Cross validation set) will contain blurry images as the model is to be prepared to work well even with low cost camera as found in webcams , CCTVs.
